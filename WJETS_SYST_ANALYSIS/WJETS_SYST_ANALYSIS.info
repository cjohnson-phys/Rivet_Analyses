Description:
  'Differential cross-sections of properties of the four leading jets in
  $W$+jets production, using mc12_8TeV_Sherpa. Observables
  include jet multiplicities, $pT$, $H_T$, angular distances, and others.
  All observables are available using jets with $pT>30$ and $pT>20$ GeV.
  This is a modified version of the ATLAS_2012_I1083318 analysis.'
ToDo:
 - Implement the analysis, test it, remove this ToDo, and mark as VALIDATED :-)
